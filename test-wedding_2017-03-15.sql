We were friends in high school. Lost contact and lived separate lives. We both got rid of dysfunctional relationships, moved on, healed and resigned ourselves to being single and happy. Then we found each other on Facebook. We started talking everyday and the conversations moved from on-line to in person. We agreed not to date but each of our kids pointed out that if you see each other 5 - 6 times a week, it\'s a pretty solid dating relationship. We finally admitted we were in love. We continued to date and in May 2016, we moved in together. We are both even happier together than we were alone. This time around, we want there to be less focus on the wedding and more focus on the marriage. We don\'t want to worry about what we look like, if people are comfortable or if guests are having fun. We want to focus only on our vows and our promise to each other. Palisade Head is a special place for us. We would like to elope there and plan to simply use random tourists as witnesses. We want meaningful vows and a simple ceremony (with maybe a selfie - no professional photographer) only for us. As it is 300 feet above Lake Superior and footing is important, we don\'t even really plan to dress up. (Safety first :) )  We chose September 9th because that is his parent\'s wedding anniversary. They met in high school, were married over 65 years and passed away within weeks of each other. We want that. So... we are borrowing their anniversary. Time is flexible. We jut need to have enough time to get there from Duluth and enough time to get to Lutsen before dark. :) Thanks for a quote! (Sorry I\'m wordy.)'),
